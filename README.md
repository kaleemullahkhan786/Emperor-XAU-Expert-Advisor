## ⚡ Key Trading Capabilities

### 🎯 Hyper-Aggressive Execution
Unlike traditional EAs that wait for hours, **Emperor XAU** trades every high-probability candle move. It is optimized to capture the smallest price fluctuations, transforming noise into profit.

### 🛡️ Smart Recovery System
Equipped with an advanced Martingale Multiplier logic that doesn't just "stack" trades. It uses dynamic distance calculations and **Group Take Profit** management to ensure the entire trade basket exits at the first sign of a reversal.

### 💂 Account Protection (The Safety Net)
*   **Drawdown Hedging:** Automatically locks positions with a hedge if a specific drawdown % is hit, preventing account blowouts.
*   **Daily Control:** Set hard limits for daily profit and drawdown to protect your capital from over-trading.
*   **Spread Guard:** Ensures entries only occur during low-latency, tight spread conditions.
